# Sprint.AI - Development Roadmap

## Debug & Improvement
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Description** Debugging and Improving the current code

- [x] When clicking the user profile, the dropdown menu becomes unresponsive and is partially obscured by overlapping components.
  - *Fixed*: Added proper z-index, click outside handling, escape key support, and refs for better menu management

- [x] Improve the green border around text inputs
   - [x] (e.g., the header and task section search bars) is too prominent. It should only appear on hover.
   - [x] For the sign-up/sign-in forms, display the green border only when the input is valid.
   - *Fixed*: Updated Input component with conditional styling and hover states
     
- [x] The error toast currently triggers multiple times, likely due to excessive re-renders.
  - *Fixed*: Implemented proper error handling with useCallback and memoization to prevent duplicate toasts

- [x] Authentication loading issue - app stuck on "Loading Sprint.AI..." 
  - *Fixed*: Consolidated auth hooks, improved error handling, added detailed logging, and fixed Supabase client initialization
