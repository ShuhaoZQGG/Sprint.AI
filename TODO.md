# Sprint.AI - Development Roadmap

## üßπ MCP-Only AI Processing Migration

### 1. Remove Legacy AI Processing Logic
- [x] Remove all Groq/legacy NLP logic from `src/services/nlpProcessor.ts`
- [x] Remove fallback/dual-mode logic from `src/components/overlay/AIOverlay.tsx`
- [x] Remove legacy quick action logic from `src/services/quickActionHandler.ts` and related files

### 2. Refactor nlpProcessor to MCP-Only
- [x] Refactor `src/services/nlpProcessor.ts` to only support MCP-based processing
- [x] Remove all intent/entity extraction and legacy response generation
- [x] Ensure all AI queries are routed through MCP

### 3. Refactor AIOverlay to Use Only MCP
- [x] Remove "standard" mode and related UI from `src/components/overlay/AIOverlay.tsx`
- [x] Remove all non-MCP quick action logic and UI
- [x] Simplify state/UI to only show MCP-based flows, tools, and results

### 4. Fully Integrate MCP into AI Overlay
- [ ] Ensure all tool suggestions in the overlay are sourced from MCP tool registry (`src/mcp/server/registry.ts`)
- [ ] Ensure all tool executions are routed through MCP client (`src/mcp/client/toolApi.ts`)
- [ ] Ensure all conversation history and tool results are managed via MCP and context memory
- [ ] Refactor overlay UI to display MCP tool feedback, errors, and results in a user-friendly way
- [ ] Remove any remaining legacy or partial integrations in overlay logic
- [ ] Add robust error handling and user feedback for MCP tool execution failures
- [ ] Add loading and execution state indicators for MCP tool calls
- [ ] Add tests for MCP tool suggestion, execution, and result display in overlay

### 5. Update/Remove Unused Types, Hooks, and Services
- [ ] Remove unused types/interfaces from `src/types/`
- [ ] Remove or update hooks/services no longer needed (e.g., `quickActionService`)
- [ ] Update or remove tests for legacy logic

### 6. MCP Tool Registry and Client/Server Robustness
- [ ] Audit and update `src/mcp/server/registry.ts` to ensure all tools are properly registered and described
- [ ] Audit and update `src/mcp/client/toolApi.ts` and `src/mcp/client/index.ts` for robust tool execution and error handling
- [ ] Add or update tests for MCP tool registration, execution, and feedback

### 7. Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Update/add tests for MCP-only flows
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect MCP-only architecture

## üß† Enhance MCP Reasoning & Tool Orchestration

### 8. Expand Tool Coverage and Intelligent Orchestration
- [ ] Incorporate more tools from all service modules (`src/services/*`) into MCP tool registry (`src/mcp/server/registry.ts` and `src/mcp/server/index.ts`)
- [ ] Update MCP tool schemas to cover all available actions (e.g., repository listing, task creation, etc.)
- [ ] Refactor MCP server/client to support multi-step tool orchestration (e.g., if a required parameter is missing, call a tool to fetch or create it, then proceed)
- [ ] Implement reasoning logic in MCP to:
    - Detect missing parameters and resolve them by calling prerequisite tools (e.g., fetch repositories if repositoryId is missing)
    - Chain tool calls (e.g., create a task before generating a PR template)
    - Select the most relevant entity (e.g., repository or task) based on user input/context
- [ ] Add robust error handling and fallback strategies for tool orchestration
- [ ] Update tool documentation to reflect new orchestration capabilities
- [ ] Add tests for multi-step tool orchestration, error recovery, and reasoning

#### Main files to modify:
- `src/mcp/server/index.ts` (tool orchestration, reasoning logic)
- `src/mcp/server/registry.ts` (register more tools from all services)
- `src/services/*` (ensure all service tools are exportable and have clear schemas)
- `src/mcp/client/toolApi.ts`, `src/mcp/client/index.ts` (client-side orchestration support)
- `src/types/mcp.ts` (update types for multi-step tool calls if needed)
- (Optional) `src/mcp/server/orchestrator.ts` (new file for orchestration logic, if separation is desired)
- (Optional) New/updated tests: `src/mcp/server/index.test.ts`, `src/mcp/server/orchestrator.test.ts`
