# Sprint.AI - Development Roadmap

## üßπ MCP-Only AI Processing Migration

### 1. Remove Legacy AI Processing Logic
- [x] Remove all Groq/legacy NLP logic from `src/services/nlpProcessor.ts`
- [x] Remove fallback/dual-mode logic from `src/components/overlay/AIOverlay.tsx`
- [x] Remove legacy quick action logic from `src/services/quickActionHandler.ts` and related files

### 2. Refactor nlpProcessor to MCP-Only
- [x] Refactor `src/services/nlpProcessor.ts` to only support MCP-based processing
- [x] Remove all intent/entity extraction and legacy response generation
- [x] Ensure all AI queries are routed through MCP

### 3. Refactor AIOverlay to Use Only MCP
- [x] Remove "standard" mode and related UI from `src/components/overlay/AIOverlay.tsx`
- [x] Remove all non-MCP quick action logic and UI
- [x] Simplify state/UI to only show MCP-based flows, tools, and results

### 4. Fully Integrate MCP into AI Overlay
- [ ] Ensure all tool suggestions in the overlay are sourced from MCP tool registry (`src/mcp/server/registry.ts`)
- [ ] Ensure all tool executions are routed through MCP client (`src/mcp/client/toolApi.ts`)
- [ ] Ensure all conversation history and tool results are managed via MCP and context memory
- [ ] Refactor overlay UI to display MCP tool feedback, errors, and results in a user-friendly way
- [ ] Remove any remaining legacy or partial integrations in overlay logic
- [ ] Add robust error handling and user feedback for MCP tool execution failures
- [ ] Add loading and execution state indicators for MCP tool calls
- [ ] Add tests for MCP tool suggestion, execution, and result display in overlay

### 5. Update/Remove Unused Types, Hooks, and Services
- [ ] Remove unused types/interfaces from `src/types/`
- [ ] Remove or update hooks/services no longer needed (e.g., `quickActionService`)
- [ ] Update or remove tests for legacy logic

### 6. MCP Tool Registry and Client/Server Robustness
- [ ] Audit and update `src/mcp/server/registry.ts` to ensure all tools are properly registered and described
- [ ] Audit and update `src/mcp/client/toolApi.ts` and `src/mcp/client/index.ts` for robust tool execution and error handling
- [ ] Add or update tests for MCP tool registration, execution, and feedback

### 7. Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Update/add tests for MCP-only flows
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect MCP-only architecture

## üîç Testing & Quality Assurance

### 17. Testing Infrastructure
