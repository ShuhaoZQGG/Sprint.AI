For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

TODO.md layouts all the tasks todo. Each subtask marks the existing files to change and new files to create to achieve the goals, they can be used as index.

Always update TODO.md after complete the feature.
